Margs beefing with a restaurant? Poet hitting the stairs? What a week.

With the season drawing to a close and only three or four matches having any meaning to them whatsoever we started focusing on 2021/22 and who we think are going to be the players making the biggest jumps. We also talk a load of rubbish and argue about the best side of London for longer than we should. So you know, classic episode.

One of the best things about football over what has been an insane 12 months has been the rise to prominence of Micah Richards as a pundit on Sky Sports. Lovable, intelligent, hilarious, boisterous and human, Micah Richards will be to a generation the voice of the big games, but he also had an incredible playing career that resulted in a Premier League title and even then those who knew of his potential will tell you he could have achieved more. Sitting down with Poet, the former Manchester City defender talks injuries, money management, Black Lives Matter, Fiorentina and more. This is a special episode.

Youngs Teflon dropped one of the projects of the year last week and it served as a timely reminder that in the South London rapper we have one of the best rappers in the world. Respected by his peers, adored by his fans and worshipped by the connoisseurs, Tef remains an Underground Legend and while some might wonder why he's not a chart-topping pop-star, the 1 PO SHOW is more concerned with how he made himself the street icon that he is.

Poet and Miles come together again after their viral fight, Lippy and Margs join forces, Jordy and Specs make trouble and Tego tries to mediate.

212,huGNn7bLqmQ,FILTHYFELLAS,WILEY SPEAKS | 1 PO SHOW WITH POET,"Prelude:

Wiley is an important person. He is the Godfather. He had a vision for music made by black people in Britain and he forged a path for so many people of all colours and backgrounds to create great art, make a living and really impact the world. He is not without his faults and 1 PO SHOW and FilthyFellas will acknowledge them. In our opinion recent tirade was wrong and poorly considered and very dangerous. There is more to him than those Tweets though and we wanted to make sure we gave him the opportunity to clear-up as much of the mess has been left behind as possible.

We love Wiley. He means a lot to us. We do not condone prejudice in any form. Thank you for watching and for giving us and him your time.

We couldn't skip Chelsea Vs Manchester United and normally we'd be recording during the game, so as has been the tradition this season, we brought the man-dem together for a watch-along. We got to see the true Savage in Savage Dan return as Chelsea slumped to their ninth defeat of the season in February.

For all you clever pricks, if you watch this video and wonder why we don't think we should be doing live stream watch-alongs rather than edited watch-alongs then you should probably watch it again.

What a difference a Christmas makes. Arsenal were 22 unbeaten, they were planning for life in the Champions League and Unai Emery had given them their ""Arsenal back"" and Manchester United were closer to the relegation zone than the Top 4 and Jose Mourinho had them contemplating ending it all. The #FilthyFellas are always measured though. Expect them to be totally reasonable a few weeks later...

Merry Christmas from the #FilthyFellas. It was a mad 2018 and we're not going to come to the studio until the new year, so you're going to have to wait to hear what BOAT and Skribz think about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, or what Savage Dan thinks about losing to Leicester City. Instead we got the boys together to give each other New Year's Resolutions in an attempt to make our show even better in 2019.

Let us know what resolutions you'd give the boys in the comments below.

We filmed this before Jose Mourinho sacked, which you might think is an L, but actually if he'd have been fired a day before we'd have happy Manchester United fans on the show and THAT would in fact be the L.

With West Ham hosting Tottenham Hotspur at Westfield it was always going to be Craig Mitch holding corn or Stevo The Madman battling calls for relegation. The game also came through with most of the banter for the rest of the show with Alan Pardew talking way too much about Harry Kane's mum and Craig Mitch doing way too much with Harry Kane's mum's son. The boys also consider Alvaro Morata's start to the season and discuss whether or not Specs is the Filthy Fella of the year so far.

Two apologies - The FIRST is that the audio on this week's episode is a bit distorted. The SECOND is that we filmed before the Arsenal game. We're sorry.

On this week's #FilthyFellas the boys debate the Premier League's best striker - is Lukaku better than Kane? Luke Shaw being sonned by Jose Mourinho and Ross Barkley catching a quick fade in a club in Liverpool.

Arsenal only drew this weekend and still managed to make themselves a laughing stock, while Spurs might just be peaking around Chelsea's door at a title challenge. Poet and Vuj are in Miami, so we got as close as we could to Poet by bringing Kirk, his brother, in. He doesn't know the most about football, but his insights prove invaluable.

Two weeks and three games later it’s all changed, Spurs have swapped their lead in the race for Champions League football with Arsenal for a four point deficit, Liverpool are the most in-form team in English football, Manchester United are losing their grip on those elite top four positions and the Premier League is just getting interesting. This week the guys discuss Manchester United’s long-ball tactics, the true value of Tottenham’s North London Derby victory, the similarities between Liverpool now and Liverpool this time last season and a whole lot more.
