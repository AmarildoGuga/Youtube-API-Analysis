# Youtube-API-Analysis

YouTube, being one of the internet's largest search engines, handles an astonishing number of over 3 billion searches each month. However, the intricate workings of the YouTube algorithm still elude many, making it challenging to grasp the key factors that contribute to a video's success in terms of views. Recognising this, I embarked on a journey to develop a small-scale project that harnesses the power of the YouTube API, enabling me to delve into channel analysis and shed light on this intriguing subject.

With this project, my aim is to explore the statistical nuances of thriving YouTube channels, while also ensuring flexibility by allowing the analysis of multiple channels concurrently through the provided open-source code.

This endeavor serves as a platform for me to solidify my understanding of Python and API integration, further enhancing my skills in these domains.
