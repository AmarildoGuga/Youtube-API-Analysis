Let me tell you about Mourinho. Mourinho, started his first manager position at the shit club Uniao de Leiria, and in his first season he took this no talent team to 3rd place in the portuguese league before losing out to Benfica and settled for 4th place. He was then recruited directly by Porto (who finished 5th the year before with the same players) and for the next two seasons, he won the league twice (with the same team), Won the Taca de Portugal, Won the UEFA Cup, Won the Portuguese Super Cup, Won the Champions League, while also out-managing and outmaneuvering Sir Alex and his Man Utd team along the way. Then he went to Chelsea and won SIX (6) trophies in 3yrs! The real reason he left is because him and Abramovich were beefing. Then went to Inter and won more trophies his first year and the league title! Second year at Inter, won champions league, won the Coppa Italia (first time Inter EVER reached the final!), became first manager EVER to take three different clubs to semi finals/finals of Champions league, and won the league title again!!!! First year Real madrid, won second place in league, made it to champions league semi finals (fourth team he did that with) and beat Barca in Copa del Rey final. In his second year, Mourinho won the La Liga, also setting records by winning the most games in a season & most points in any top european league, and made it to the champions league semi finals again! Mourinho had won every domestic title in Spain within 2 years! He's also the only manager in history to win the super cup, domestic titles, league championships, league cups in four different european countries. In third season, made it to champions league semi finals again, second place in la liga, and runners up in copa del rey. REturns to chelsea, they finish third in the league and make it to semi finals of champions league (see a trend with Mourinho?). Following year Chelsea won the league under mourinho, and the league cup final. Third year at chelsea, things went to shit because of turmoil with Abramovic again... Mourinho leaves... goes to Man Utd, in his first year wins the EFL cup, community shield cup, and UEFA Europa League cup. In his second year at United they were 2nd in the league, runners up in FA cup and UEFA Super Cup. And in Mourinho's last season, everything fell apart because the board refused to back him!.... Every time Mourinho falls out of grace, is because he wants to win and he wants control to build the team he needs to win. He is a winner his entire career! That's who he is! Would Klopp or Pep be as successful if they didn't get the backing and the players the wanted? NO! Not even as close as Mourinho! Mourinho is the definition of starting from the bottom and always taking teams with average chances of winning and makes them winners! He's only toxic if the board is stopping his genius and vision to win and he lashes out.. But no one is perfect! If Mourinho has the power that Wenger had at Arsenal, no team would look at Arsenal lightly!!!! We would have massive success! Everyone praises Pep Guardiola.... I say you all are foolish! What did Pep Guardiola achieve that was better than Mourinho? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!... Pep went from the best Barca team in the world (I mean a baby could've managed them to victory), then he went to arguably the second best team in the world Bayern Munich (again a baby could've managed them to victory), and now he's managing one of the top three teams in the world right now with Manchester City! Pep never developed these teams, these were already the best successful teams in the world with the best players in the world, and you all praise him for what? Standing on the sidelines and pretending to look like he's doing something? Do you honestly believe, that Pep is teaching these already SUPER MEGA STAR TALENTED PLAYERS, how to play futbol? LMFAO, you fire Pep and the team is still succesful after he leaves because all he is, is a brand name with character (Pep Guardiola). But if you fire Mourinho, the team struggles again because Mourinho was the heart beat. If we go for Mourinho, we have to back him and give him control to be creatively free and we all benefit and everyone is happy. If we try and confine him, he lashes out and let's you know... Mourinho is the perfect reflection of a fan who could be a manager. As fans we lash out if the team is doing bad, and for Mourinho, he lashes out at the board if they are doing bad and won't support his goals to make the team better. It's what we all want! No manager in the world, has accomplished what Mourinho has, and arguably, No manager in the world is better than him tactically. They may have a better overall team, but they are by no means, better than him as a manager! So, when you talk about Jose Mario dos Santos Mourinho Felix... Put some respect on his motherfucking name! Get your facts straight! Know what you speak of before you speak! You all are John Snows and you know nothing!... Mourinho for Arsenal!
